# DL-basic-NN-implementation
This amateur attempt of mine implements a mini-batch gradient descent algorithm to predict crop recommendations based on input features. The dataset consists of 7 input features, such as soil quality, weather conditions, etc., and 1 output which is the recommended crop.

# Overview
In this implementation, we use a simple neural network with a single neuron to perform the prediction. The mini-batch gradient descent algorithm updates the weights and bias of the neuron to minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the predicted and actual crop recommendations.
